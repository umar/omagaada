Marksmarty
----------

A modified version of one of the many Markdown modules for Drupal,
styled after wiki.module in application, and meant to act as the
"Markdown with SmartyPants" formatting option in MovableType. This one
applies the filtering "live"--it does not need to be enabled per post
and does not add extra markup per post. This is because Markdown by
design is meant to coexist with HTML as well as be as human-readable as
possible when left as "source."
